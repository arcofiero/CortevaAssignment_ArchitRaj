# Weather Data API Deployment on AWS

## 1. Database: Amazon RDS (PostgreSQL)
- **Purpose**: Use Amazon RDS for scalable cloud database setup.
- **Steps**:
  - Configure instance for security and capacity.
  - Migrate schema to RDS.
  - Update API to use RDS endpoint.

## 2. API: AWS Elastic Beanstalk
- **Purpose**: Effortlessly deploy, manage, and scale the Weather API in the cloud.
- **Steps**:
  - Package API code.
  - Deploy on Elastic Beanstalk Python environment.
  - Allow traffic on necessary ports.

## 3. Data Ingestion: AWS Lambda & CloudWatch Events
- **Purpose**: Run serverless data ingestion tasks without provisioning or managing servers.
- **Steps**:
  - Package data ingestion as a Lambda function.
  - Schedule using CloudWatch Events (e.g., daily runs).

## 4. Monitoring: Amazon CloudWatch
- **Purpose**: Gain insights into application performance and operational health.
- **Steps**:
  - Monitor RDS, Elastic Beanstalk, and Lambda metrics.
  - Enable logging for debugging and insights.

## 5. Security: AWS VPC, Security Groups, and IAM
- **Purpose**: Ensure that the architecture remains secure and resilient against threats.
- **Steps**:
  - Deploy all services within a VPC.
  - Restrict traffic with security groups.
  - Set IAM permissions for services.

## 6. Backup: RDS Snapshots
- **Purpose**: Safeguard your data against accidental loss or application errors.
- **Steps**:
  - Enable automated RDS backups.
  - Set retention policy (e.g., 30 days).

---

**Summary**: Use AWS tools for a secure, scalable, and monitored cloud deployment of the Weather Data API, database, and scheduled tasks.
